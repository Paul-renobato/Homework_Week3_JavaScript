# Homework_Week3_JavaScript
For this week of the homework I will implement a password generator using javascript. Utilizing the work and activities from this week I will be using Functions, Variables, Conditions, Iterations, Methods, etc. 

## Getting Started 
I added the Variables for the Numeric, Alphabet, and Special Characters then started a function for the generated password by adding the prompts when clicking the "generate password" button.

### Prompts
* "How long will the password be"
* "Will this contain numerics"
* "Will this contain lower case"
* "Will this contain upper case"
* "Will this contain special"

## The User's Choices
After adding the variables and prompts I started inputting the iterations for the users choice when the browser ask the prompts for the generated password. I had to put in the different combinations of passwords that could be generated with the iterations in the javascript.

## The Function for the Random Password Generator
After adding the iterations I started the random generator for all the variables and iterations the users picks by adding the loop from the those choices and adding the text from that loop.
